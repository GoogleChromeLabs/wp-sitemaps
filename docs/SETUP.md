# Local Setup

To get a local environment set up locally we would recommend cloning the [sitemaps-quickstart](https://github.com/humanmade/sitemaps-quickstart) repo and following the installation instructions there.

## Plugin Installation

- Once you have a local environment configured, clone or download this repo.
	- If you have downloaded the plugin, extract the plugin from the zip file.
- Place the plugin in the plugins folder in your local WordPress install. Usually `wp-content/plugins/`
- Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.
